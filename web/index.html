        <p>
            I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, 
            I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.

            If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. 
            And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
